# Development guide

[Back to the README](../README.md)

Use Node.js ≥ 22 for development and tests (CI uses Node 22). OpenDeck uses
the local Node binary pinned by `npm run install:opendeck`; the original macOS
host uses Stream Deck’s managed Node 20 runtime. See the [README](../README.md).

## Architecture

```
  Stream Deck+ plugin ── spawns ──► cmux CLI ──► cmux socket (automation mode)
        ├── CLI ──► Orca worktrees (attention)
        ├── CLI ──► Herdr local sessions + saved SSH machines (attention)
        └── TCP ──► codexbar serve (LCD usage)

  opendeck.ts        native WebSocket host: 15-key Orca queue, N1 buttons/knob
  plugin.ts          original macOS entry: connect, load config, start services

  config.ts          defaults + defensive resolveConfig()

                     eventStatus (live state from the event stream + CPU)
    orca/            worktree snapshot normalization + terminal focus
    herdr/           snapshots, terminal identity, existing-host mapping + focus

    services/        store, cmux/orca/herdr/codexbar polls, cmuxEvents (event stream)
  actions/           attentionKey (8 keys), dialStrip (4 dials): thin SDK glue

### Orca agent state

The Orca source joins `worktree ps` agent lifecycle rows to connected entries
from `terminal list` using `worktreeId` and `tabId:leafId`. Every agent gets
its own stable entity key, including agents sharing a worktree. Historical
agents without live terminals disappear. Live agents without lifecycle data
(including floating terminals) show unknown state, not fabricated activity.
Focus refreshes the terminal inventory and switches the exact stored handle;
a closed or replaced pane produces an error instead of focusing a neighbor.

## The device profiles

For OpenDeck, `node scripts/opendeck-profile.mjs n1-DEVICE_SERIAL` creates a
new Muxboard profile with 15 keys and three encoder positions. Close OpenDeck
first, then restart and select it. Existing profiles are never overwritten.
The original macOS installer below remains separate from the OpenDeck host.

`scripts/install-profile.mjs` writes a Muxboard profile straight into the Stream
Deck app's `ProfilesV3` store (the app's own V3 format, keyed to the connected
Stream Deck+'s device id), placing the Attention Slot action on all 8 keys and
the Muxboard Dial on all 4 dials. Run it with the app closed
(`npm run install-profile`). The app picks it up on next launch and you select it
from the profile dropdown.

This deliberately bypasses the app's profile importer, which rejects
programmatically-built `.streamDeckProfile` archives as "content corrupted" on
recent macOS builds (confirmed across clean/stored zips and deterministic UUIDs).
Elgato's only supported way to produce an importable profile is to build it in the
app UI and _Export_ it, so we skip import entirely and write the store format the
app itself uses.

Rendering is SVG-first: Stream Deck's `setImage` accepts SVG data-URIs, so keys
and LCD segments are plain strings, with no native canvas dependency and fully
testable. Each action caches the last SVG per instance to debounce redundant
draws (anti-flicker). Polls never overlap, and last-good data is retained on
failure so a transient outage never blanks the display.

## Configuration overrides

The plugin reads Stream Deck global settings once when it connects. There is
currently no settings editor in the property inspector. For a source build,
adjust the fallbacks in [src/config.ts](../src/config.ts). Most fields use
`DEFAULT_CONFIG`. Source enablement falls back to `"auto"` in `coerceEnableOrca`,
while Herdr allow-lists and machine inclusion fall back to `[]` and `true`
inside `resolveConfig`. For those fields, also change the matching resolver
fallback because editing `DEFAULT_CONFIG` alone is insufficient. Rebuild with
`npm run build` and fully quit and reopen Stream Deck to reload the plugin.
Previously stored global settings override these fallbacks.

## Development watcher

`npm run dev` builds and links the plugin, starts a background CodexBar server
if needed, and keeps watching for code changes. Use another terminal for
`npm run install-profile`, or stop the watcher with Ctrl-C first. The watcher
starts CodexBar without launchd supervision. Use the keep-alive installer in
[CodexBar support](../README.md#codexbar-support) for persistent use. Fully quit
and reopen Stream Deck if the CLI's plugin restart does not load a rebuilt
bundle. Manifest changes may also require re-linking.

## Testing

```bash
npm test        # Unit tests: normalization, slotting, dual-shape codexbar,
                # SVG structure, store dial machines, service offline retention
npm run validate
npm run typecheck
npm run test:herdr:e2e  # Real Herdr CLI/server integration in isolated sessions
npm run e2e:streamdeck # Built plugin + real SDK with simulated device/services
```

The Herdr end-to-end harness requires Herdr ≥ 0.9.3 on PATH (or `HERDR_BIN`),
creates only uniquely named `muxboard-e2e-*` sessions, and removes those sessions
in cleanup. It does not change the default session or existing user sessions.

The Stream Deck suite runs the built plugin against a real SDK WebSocket peer
with controlled CLI and HTTP fixtures: 49 scenarios and 103 assertions cover
rendering, source and agent filters, source routing, existing-host focus, and
completion acknowledgement across plugin restarts and tab-wide native seen
changes. It simulates device hardware and services. It does not connect to live
SSH machines or use physical keys.

## Plugin troubleshooting

- **`require is not defined` / exit code 1:** the bundle must be CommonJS with
  a `.cjs` extension because the package uses `"type": "module"`. `npm run build`
  emits `bin/plugin.cjs`. The manifest's `CodePath` points at that file.
- **Manifest changes do not appear:** run
  `npx streamdeck link com.mrshu.muxboard.sdPlugin` again and fully quit and
  reopen Stream Deck. A plugin restart alone does not re-read the manifest.
